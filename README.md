# Panocropper

Basically, this is a bot for Telegram that uses my other [project](https://github.com/eqlion/cropper-for-instagram) with some changes to generate a sequence of photos based on the panorama user sends. It might be extremely handy if one wants to post it on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV9WplIj7Yl/).

# Usage

All you need to do is to message the bot [here](https://t.me/panocropperbot) and follow the instructions it sends.

# Etc

The bot is hosted on Heroku.
